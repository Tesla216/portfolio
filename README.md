TicTacToe AI:
This was made during my CS50 course with hardvard the runner.py file was not made by me and was given to us.
The TicTacToe.py was made by me and contains the actual logic and AI for the program.

Mnist was a personal project that I worked on because I wanted to try diffrent AI models that were less common.
I like the way it turned out with a 96.5% accuracy raiting with 10,000 test data points.
One thing I would have done diffrent when working on this project is made it to go faster and not have it itterate through the Traing set every time.

Thank you for your time,
Connor Diehl
